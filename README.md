1. Harmonic Number
    a. Desc -> Prints the Nth harmonic number: 1/1 + 1/2 + ... + 1/N
    (http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~chvatal/notes/harmonic.html).
    b. I/P -> The Harmonic Value N. Ensure N != 0
    c. Logic -> compute 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ... + 1/N
    d. O/P -> Print the Nth Harmonic Value.


2. Java Program to Swap Two Numbers without Third number.


3. Sum of three Integer adds to ZERO
    a. Desc -> A program with cubic running time. Read in N integers and counts the
    number of triples that sum to exactly 0.
    b. I/P -> N number of integer, and N integer input array
    c. Logic -> Find distinct triples (i, j, k) such that a[i] + a[j] + a[k] = 0
    d. O/P -> One Output is number of distinct triplets as well as the second output is to
    print the distinct triplets.
